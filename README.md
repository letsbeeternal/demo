Be Eternal â€” Vite + React + Tailwind + Framer Motion
------------------------------------------------------

This zip contains a single-file React homepage (src/App.jsx) that you edited on the canvas.

How to run locally (node + npm required):
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:
- The file you edited is included as src/App.jsx (retain it when you edit content).
- Replace public/logo.png with your real logo. App references /logo.png.
- Update SITE_CONTENT.services[*].link values with your real service page URLs.
- Tailwind/PostCSS config included (tailwind.config.cjs, postcss.config.cjs).

Deployment:
- Push this repo to GitHub and connect to Vercel. Vercel will auto-detect the Vite app and deploy.
